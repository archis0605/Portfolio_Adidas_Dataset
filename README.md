# Portfolio_Adidas_Dataset
Set of real world dataset tasks is completed by using the Python Pandas and Matplotlib library.


## Background Information:
In this porfolio we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 5 products worth of sales data. 
The data contains hundreds of thousands of footwear store purchases broken down by product type, cost, region, state, city etc.

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

1. Drop NaN values from DataFrame
2. Removing column based on a condition
3. Changing the column name
4. Removing rows based on a condition
5. Reindexing rows based on a condition
6. Adding Month and Year column (to_datetime)

Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. 
In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

1. What was the highest number of sales in which year?
2. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
3. What was the average price for each product? And overall average price of all products?
4. What was the best retailer for sales? How much was earned that retailers?
5. What method is most efficienct for sales?

To answer these questions we walk through many different openpyxl, pandas, and matplotlib methods. They include:

1. Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
2. Plotting bar charts, lines graphs, and pie charts to visualize our results
3. Labeling our graphs
